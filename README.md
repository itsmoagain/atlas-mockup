# Agroclimatic Atlas (Mockup)

A lightweight prototype of the Agroclimatic Atlas developed during my work at the USDA Climate Hub. This version is scoped for scientific software sustainability: focused, reproducible, and modular.

## 📊 Purpose
This repo demonstrates how long-term climate indicators (NDVI, SPI, temperature anomalies) can be:
- Integrated into open geospatial tools
- Used to support land-use decision-making
- Modularized for reproducibility and reuse

## 📁 Contents
- `netcdf/` – sample NetCDF or ERA5 datasets
- `notebooks/` – visualization and analysis examples
- `utils/` – small functions to process climate rasters
- `docs/` – plain-language writeups of data logic

## 🔄 Scientific Software Themes
- Open data + reproducibility
- Multi-decade indicator tracking
- Region-specific anomaly overlays
